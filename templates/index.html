        <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-700 mx-auto">
            <p>Christopher was born on 1st January 1959 in Molyko, Buea, to Mr. Stephen Nyahchong Feka and Mrs. Mary Futella Feka. He was the youngest of five children.</p>
            
            <p>He began his primary education at St. Andrew’s Primary School, Muea, Buea, before continuing at St. Herman’s Primary School, Ekona, where he obtained his First School Leaving Certificate. His secondary education commenced at St. Bede’s College, Ashing-Kom, and he completed his high school education at CPC Bali. He later pursued higher education at the University of Yaoundé (Ngoa-Ekellé), earning a Bachelor’s degree in Law. He earned a Postgraduate Diploma in Public Management from the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom, and a Postgraduate Diploma in Human Resources Management from the Galilee Institute of Public Management. He further distinguished himself by obtaining a Master’s degree in Human Resources Management from Southern University of Delaware, USA.</p>
            
            <p>He entered into a blessed union with Dr. Stella Anumbundem Feka, and together they were graced with three children.</p>
            
            <p>Christopher devoted himself to the public service, beginning his career at the Ministry of Lands and Town Planning as Assistant Chief of Personnel. His outstanding capabilities led to his transfer to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MINEF), where he was appointed Chief of Personnel. With the creation of the Ministry of Environment, Nature Protection, and Sustainable Development (MINEPDED), he continued his exemplary service as Sub-Director, a position he held until his retirement. Within the ministry, he also led the SIGIPES Unit, overseeing the management of personnel and payroll systems for the civil service, demonstrating both technical expertise and steadfast leadership. Even after retirement, he continued to share his expertise as a consultant in Human Resources and Environmental Governance with APME, contributing meaningfully to the development of public sector human resource practices and environmental policy frameworks.</p>

            <p>Beyond his professional achievements, Christopher was deeply committed to the Church and his community. In 2021, he was elected Diocesan President of the Catholic Men Association (CMA), reflecting his dedication to faith, moral leadership, and service. He also actively engaged with alumni associations, serving as Branch President and subsequently National President of SABESA, and as Coordinator of BOBANS, demonstrating a lifelong commitment to mentorship, education, and community development.</p>
            
            <p class="italic">Christopher’s life was characterized by integrity, devotion, and a profound sense of responsibility to both family and society. He was a man whose faith, scholarship, and professional excellence inspired those around him. His legacy is reflected not only in his professional contributions but also in the lives of the family, colleagues, and communities he touched with his wisdom, guidance, and compassion.</p>
